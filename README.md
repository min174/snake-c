## 𓆗 Description 𓆗
I wanted to refresh my memory on coding in C. I wanted a project that I could have fun with and be able to expand while I grow as a C developer. I love video games so what better than to start with one of the classics? (I named the snake, Sally)

## 𓆙 Features 𓆙

- **Snake Growth**  
The snake grows when she eats a fruit.

- **Score Tracking**  
The score will be tracked on the screen.

- **Speed**  
The snake moves faster the higher the score.

- **Main Menu**  
I tried to create a cute but simple main menu screen which you can choose from three options, play, leaderboard and quit.

- **Leaderboard**  
I created a leaderboard that showcases the top 5 players, I included 5 prewritten highscore owners.

- **Pause**  
The user can pause the game by pressing "P".

## 𓆓 Future Features 𓆓
- [ ] The user is able to join the leaderboard, by writing their name and beating the prewritten players.
- [ ] There is more than one fruit. The @ gives one point, * gives two points and X takes away one point.
