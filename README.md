## Description
I wanted to refresh my memory on coding in C. I wanted a project that I could have fun with and be able to expand while I grow as a C developer. I love video games so what better than to start with one of the classics?

## Features
The features I have implemented so far:

snake growth
the snake grows as it eats fruit

score tracking
the score will be tracked in front of the player on the screen

speed
the speed the snake moves in will be increased the higher the score

main menu
I tried to create a cute but simple main menu screen which you can choose from three options, play, leaderboard and quit.

leaderboard
I created a leaderboard that showcases the top 5 players, it will be continuously updated once the user passes the 5 preset scores. you can insert your name and it will be available to see even after you terminate the program as it is written in a text file in the data folder.

##how to run the program

## to do list!
